# Parametrix
On-chain, fully automated parametric insurance.

We provide parametric insurance for data centers and the lenders financing their infrastructure upgrades and maintenance.

Coverage targets natural hazards such as heat waves, floods, and droughts. Payout triggers are defined upfront and enforced on-chain, based on objective data sources. Depending on the product, triggers may reflect direct physical impacts (for example ambient temperature or flood depth) or indirect operational stress (for example power price spikes, grid curtailment events, or cooling efficiency constraints).
